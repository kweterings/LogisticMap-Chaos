# Chaos Theory: An Approach Using Logistic Map
###### Created by Kai Weterings
I am Physics student doing their bachelors, and enjoying learning various parts of the field through creating coding projects.
I hope this helps others grasp a baseline understanding also.

The following repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook explaining the principles of Chaos Theory using the logistic map equation. 
There are various visual aids which explain the angles of this approach alongside some text based explanations.
I hope you will enjoy the interactive plot (including Sliders) to better see the response of the logistic
map equation to the input initial conditions. The .png files are preview of the plots created by the Jupyter Notebook.

If necessary, jupyter can easily be installed via the Command Prompt or WSL to be able to use Jupyter as a localhost.

If there are any question I'd be happy to answer any of them, hence contact me by any means possible.
